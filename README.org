* rcl's dotfiles

I hope you like fiddling with your `.spacemacs.d` ad nauseam, 'cause I obviously do.
This is a fork of [[https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles][hrs' dotfiles]] repo. I depart from it in that I now use Spacemacs and not plain Emacs.
However, I still do three things inspired by his repo:
- Unique shell command (sudo bash install_all.sh) to install everything I need in a system
- Stow all dotfiles to be able to put them under version control easily
- Emacs/Spacemacs configuration maintained in a literate programming style

* Installation

Clone this thing wherever you like (I use `~/.dotfiles`), and run the `install.sh` script. That'll set up a bunch of symlinks
in your home directory (e.g., `~/.bashrc` â†’ `~/.dotfiles/bash/.bashrc`) and
install a handful of required Ruby gems.

[GNU `stow`]: https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

It won't overwrite existing files, so move those out of the way first.

This isn't *really* intended for anyone's use but my own, and it's catered to my
way of doing things (duh), so, you know, be prepared for that.

Enjoy! =)
