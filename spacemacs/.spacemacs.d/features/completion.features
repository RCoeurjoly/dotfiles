Feature: Test Completing using ecukes
  In order to test functions that use completing method calls
  As an Ecukes user
  I want to run this feature successfully

  Scenario: Choose Color
    When I start an action chain
    When I press "M-x"
    And I type "et-choose-color"
    And I press "RET"
    And I type "CadetBlue"
    And I press "RET"
    And I execute the action chain
    Then et-curr-color should be "CadetBlue"
